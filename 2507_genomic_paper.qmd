## Methods
Genomic analysis
High quality genomic DNA was extracted from PBMC using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Target sequencing for 280 human genes (coding exongs and unstranslated regions) and HTLV-1 genome was performed as previously described. (Yamigishi, 2021) After enrichment of target regions with baits, genomic DNA was sequenced using a HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina) with 100-bp paired-end (PE) reads.

Panel-based ultra-deep sequencing quantitatively detected deletions and mutations with high sensitivity, compared with WGS


We evaluated longitudinally collected genomic DNA from 4 asymptomatic carriers.
FASTP as previous step
The reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg38 using BWA-MEM2 (version).
Somatic mutation candidates were obtained using Mutect2 and following GATK standard pipeline, and annotated with Funcotator. Candidate mutations were:
